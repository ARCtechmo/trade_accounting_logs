1. I will need to create additional tables 
2. The tables needed are time entry logs, strategy performance, and monetary performance by asset class.
3. The data currently reside in excel, it is internally generated, and not dependent on an outside source.
4. I do not anticipate a need for extensive data wrangling although some of the formatting is not clean. 
5. I will need to use a combination of Python and manual entry to import data.
