    began the process to identify, extract, and export the unmatched
    transactions from the fx data; added a table fx_unmatched to the
    database; next work on the fx_dev_mode.py to extract the rows
    with unmatched only open_ids and export it into the
    logs_metrics_app_dev_mode.py app

    sucessfully exported the data from fx_dev_mode.py into the

    successfully tested  the code in fx_dev_mode.py that returns
    the correct data and added a couple of lines to fx_dev_mode.py

    integrate fx_dev_mode.py functions into logs_metrics_app_dev_mode.py
    that will pull the rows into the database

    continued data formatting and began to construct the final list
    of that will be used to import into the database; the dates have
    all been tested on one year of data and all formats correct;

    the closing transaction ids so this needs to be fixed next time.
