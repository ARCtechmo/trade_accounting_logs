I will need to create additional tables 
The tables needed are time entry logs, income-expense, strategy performance, and monetary performance by asset class.
The data currently reside in excel, it is internally generated, and not dependent on an outside source.
I do not anticipate a need for extensive data wrangling although some of the formatting is not clean. 
I will need to use a combination of Python and manual entry to import data.

For accounting purposes, keep the transactions separate from the performance data.
There will be two separate databases: transactions.db and performance.db
