Known bugs and items that need to be fixed

(1) logs_metrics_app_dev_mmode.py file: BUG
 edge cases where the fx_ broker has duplicate close or open transaction ids
the export_corrected_duplicate_id() function is in testing mode and attempts 
to correct the edge cases where there there are duplicate close or open 
transaction ids. I have not yet found a complete solution so the program will 
generate a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ERROR when it encounters a duplicate close or
open transaction id already in the fx_log table. 

(2) fx_dev_mode.py file: NOT A BUG - Just an annoying feature
the interest transaction ids have dupliactes so I added a decimal point to the 
end of each transaction id to avoid UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ERRORS. However, the decimals
are not commensurate with the transaction ids. Ideally, the decimals should indicate
the number of duplicates (e.g. 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 means four duplicates). I spennt an 
enormous amount of time and effort get the duplicate transaction ids in order along with
the commensurate decimals but failed.  Come back to this problem later.
