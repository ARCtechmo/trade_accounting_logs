Known bugs and items that need to be fixed

(1) edge cases where the fx_ broker has duplicate close or open transaction ids
the export_corrected_duplicate_id() function is in testing mode and attempts 
to correct the edge cases where there there are duplicate close or open 
transaction ids. I have not yet found a complete solution so the program will 
generate a  a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ERROR when it encounters a duplicate close or
open transaction id already in the fx_log table.
