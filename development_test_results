development phase test results


4/30/2022 logs_metrics_app_dev_mode.py upload .csv files for each month and  query data test results:
ran sql queries on each month for commissions, realized P&L, financing, and broker credits;
the sql queries for comissions, realized P&L, and  borker credits all returned the correct results
the interest debit / credit returned correct results on the data that I modified
problems / issues:
1. I was unable to build a query to add the interst_debit / credit from the two tables


4/30/2022 logs_metrics_app_dev_mode.py upload entire year data from fx_2021_test.csv test results:
the purpose was to test uploading the entire year's worth of data
no errors occurred during the upload 
problems / issues: 
1. the program failed to upload all of the data and there were missing months


5/1/2022 fx_dev_mode.py .csv files with missing transaction data causes an error
I received a traceback error on line 610 the program did not recognize the "broker" variable
some files worked fine while others produced an error; upon furter inspection I noticed the issue 
is not with my program but with the broker data
1. some of the .csv files are missing trade data; 
2. specifically those .csv files that only contain "financing", "commission" and broker credit data
   will produce an error
3. when you upload the data you need to ensure it is not missing transaction data or the program may crash
4. I will need to fix this so the program works regardless of missing transaction data

6/25/2022 td_dev_mode.py sucessfull testing complete
1. tested all monthly and yearly .csv files with the correct output

9/4/2022 fx_dev_mode.py
1. updated the code to place each section under a functions.
2. corrected the error where .csv files with no trade transactions would cause an error
3. corrected the error where the spacing in the currenty pair column in the .csv files could cause an error
4. Note: I have not completely removed the possibility of a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ERROR

9/5/2022 ib_dev_mode.py and td_dev_mode.py
1. added user input and removed unnecessary comment and print lines

10/2/2022 - logs_metrics_app_dev_mode.py
1. successfully completed the first phase of control flow testing
2. successfully exported all transaction data from all .csv files into the database with no errors or bugs

10/29/2022 - unittest completed
